In the digital age when the web is an integral part of our daily lives, it is important for software engineers to understand the URL journey from the time it is typed in a browser to the rendering of a web page In this blog post, Let’s dive into it the complex action that occurs when you type " and press Enter." This tour covers DNS, TCP/IP, firewall, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancer, web server, application server, database and much more.

1. DNS queries:
The process begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) query. If you type in a URL like "https://www.google.com", your computer should look for the IP address associated with that domain. It sends a DNS query to a DNS server, asking for the IP address of www.google.com. When the information is stored on the DNS server, it returns the IP address. Otherwise, it queries other DNS servers until it finds a valid IP address.

2. TCP/IP:
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server. TCP is responsible for establishing a reliable, communication channel between clients and servers. Browsers and servers exchange packets, ensuring the integrity and reliability of data transferred.

3. Wall of Fire:
When a TCP connection is established, data packets pass through the firewall. Firewalls act as a security barrier, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They play an important role in protecting the network from unauthorized access and potential threats.

4. Using HTTPS/SSL:
Security is paramount in today’s communication infrastructure. Hypertext DeliveryTitle: Navigating URLs: Website Search
