Issue Summary:

Duration: February 13th, 2024, 10:00 PM - February 14th, 2024, 2:00 AM (GMT)
Impact: The user-facing API service experienced a complete outage, leaving approximately 75% of users feeling as lost as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Users encountered errors galore, akin to a digital tantrum, disrupting critical functionality.
Root Cause: Turns out our load balancer decided to play favorites, directing an excessive amount of traffic to one lonely backend server, which promptly threw a digital hissy fit and crashed harder than a computer with a caffeine addiction.
Timeline:

10:00 PM: Issue detected as monitoring alerts screamed louder than a teenager's favorite band.
10:05 PM: Engineers jumped into action, initially suspecting the database had decided to take a nap.
10:20 PM: Like detectives on a wild goose chase, engineers chased down the wrong lead, thinking the database was the culprit. Oh, the drama!
10:40 PM: Incident escalated to the infrastructure team, who put on their capes and swooped in to save the day.
11:15 PM: Eureka! The load balancer was caught red-handed, playing favorites and causing all the trouble.
12:00 AM: Load balancer configuration corrected, and traffic was evenly distributed among the backend servers, restoring peace to the digital universe.
2:00 AM: Service fully restored, error rates back to normal, and engineers celebrated with virtual high-fives all around. Crisis averted!
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the chaos was a mischievous load balancer, playing favorites and overwhelming one backend server with more traffic than a rush hour commute. To fix the issue, engineers swiftly corrected the load balancer's behavior, ensuring traffic was distributed evenly among all backend servers, restoring harmony to the digital realm.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent future shenanigans, we're taking the following steps:

Load Balancer Configuration Check: We're giving the load balancer a stern talking-to, reviewing its configuration to ensure it plays fair and distributes traffic evenly.
Automated Monitoring Magic: Introducing automated monitoring systems to keep an eye on traffic patterns and catch any misbehaving load balancers in the act.
Load Testing Laughs: We're turning load testing into a party, regularly simulating different traffic scenarios to uncover any potential issues before they crash the party.
Incident Response Improv: Hosting improv sessions for our engineering teams to sharpen their incident response skills and troubleshoot with the finesse of a seasoned detective.
Tasks:

Load Balancer Confession: Conduct a thorough audit of load balancer configurations to ensure they're on their best behavior.
Automated Alert Party: Set up automated alerts to catch any load balancer shenanigans before they turn into full-blown incidents.
Load Testing Bash: Develop a load testing playbook, complete with party hats and confetti, to ensure our systems can handle anything thrown their way.
Incident Response Improv Workshop: Schedule an incident response improv workshop to help our teams think on their feet and tackle issues with style.
With these measures in place, we're confident we'll keep the digital circus running smoothly and avoid any more unexpected performances from our mischievous load balancer. Let's keep the party going! ðŸŽ‰
